# Leave Management System Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed and Enhancements Made

### 1. Fixed "Unknown" Data Display Issues

#### Problem:

- Included employee position, gender, department code
- Added HOD and Principal approver names
- Used LEFT JOIN instead of INNER JOIN to handle missing relationships
- Enhanced data for Admin, SuperAdmin, HOD, and Principal roles

**C. Created Sample Data (`src/db/sample_leave_applications.sql`)**
- Added sample leave applications with different statuses
- Includes Pending, HOD Approved, Principal Approved, and Rejected applications
- Provides realistic test data to verify the fixes

#### Improvements Made:

**A. Enhanced Filter Section (`src/pages/admin/leave-allocation.tsx`)**
- Added gradient background and modern styling
- Improved department and year selection with visual indicators
